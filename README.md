A game originally made for iPhone but made it into WebGL.

This is a game ( kind of a game like Super Smash Bros. ) where you can edit your character's status or
action style and make them fight automatically.

Sorry but its just a test... But I'll make this better in the near future.


---HOW TO PLAY---

1. Click somewhere in the screen (Where it say "PIXEL") to move to the next scene. 
2. Choose a character and touch.
3. Edit your character's status. If done, touch "Confirm".
4. Choose a character ( Not the same character as you ) that you'd like to fight and touch.
5. Edit the enemy character's status. If done, touch "Confirm".
6. Touch "Go To Battle"

7. Watch them fight!! 

MORE...
At the character selection scene, touch "Go to change script".
After the scene changes, select a character and take a look at the algorithm
(How the characters are thinking and fighting)
